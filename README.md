## Features

- **Workflow Management**: Create, update, and manage scheduled tasks
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Schedule jobs with cron expressions and precise intervals
- **Multiple Workflow Types Support**: 
    - `HEARTBEAT`: Simple health check jobs
    - `CONTAINER`: Execute commands in Docker containers
- **Distributed Architecture**: Microservices-based design for scalability
- **High Availability**: Fault-tolerant operation with no single point of failure
- **Notification System**: Real-time alerts and status updates
- **Observability**: Built-in OpenTelemetry integration for tracing and metrics
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication and authorization

## Architecture

Chronoverse follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Services

- **Server**: API gateway that handles client interactions and routes requests to appropriate services
- **Users Service**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and user profile data
- **Workflows Service**: Enables creation, configuration, and management of workflow definitions
- **Jobs Service**: Handles scheduled job instances and their lifecycle management
- **Notifications Service**: Delivers real-time alerts and status updates

### Worker Components

- **Scheduling Worker**: Identifies jobs due for execution based on their schedules and initiates the execution process
- **Workflow Worker**: Prepares jobs for execution, handling any build steps required before execution
- **Execution Worker**: Executes scheduled jobs in isolated containers with proper resource management

Each component communicates through message queuing to ensure reliability and scalability in distributed environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
