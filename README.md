## Features

- **Job Management**: Create, update, and manage scheduled tasks
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Schedule jobs with cron expressions and precise intervals
- **Multiple Job Types Support**: 
    - `HEARTBEAT`: Simple health check jobs

## Architecture

Chronoverse follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **users-service**: Handles user authentication and management
- **jobs-service**: Manages job definitions and configurations
- **scheduling-job**: Identifies jobs due for execution and schedules them
- **workflow-job**: Prepares jobs for execution if build step is required
- **execution-job**: Executes scheduled jobs in containers
- **server**: API gateway for client interactions
